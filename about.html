                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The CCG clan was created on 14-12-2019 by Mitchel "Yami" Staal. They started with only 3 members and
                    with the goal to make a community where everyone can enjoy playing games! The CCG clan was created
                    not only for competitive gaming, but also recreational gaming. The mix between casual and
                    competitive gaming results in a good way to improve ourselves and help eachother.</p>

                <h3>CCG in the present</h3>
                <p>Currently the clan is sitting on 13 Members and hopefully there will be many more in the future. We
                    expended to not only just clan members, but also community members. People that are not really
                    interested in joining the clan, but are just there to support and play together.</p>
